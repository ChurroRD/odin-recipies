    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the beans (and the water in which they boiled) in a blender and puree. Strain the 
            beans to get rid of the skins and undissolved solids.</li>
        <li>Pour the beans, coconut milk, evaporated milk, salt, sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, cloves, and sweet potatoes into a pot.
            Simmer over very low heat until the sweet potatoes are cooked through. Stir regularly to avoid sticking.
            Add the raisins and simmer for another 10 minutes (don't worry that it may look too thin, the cream of beans will 
            get much thicker when chilled). Remove the cinnamon sticks (and cloves, if you like).</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature. Chill before serving.</li>

    </ol>
