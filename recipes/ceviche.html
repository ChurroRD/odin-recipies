        <h3>What is Ceviche?</h3>
        <p>Ceviche is a healthy Peruvian dish that is usually served as an appetizer.
         It is generally made from raw fresh fish or shrimp, that is
          marinated in lemon and/or lime citrus juices. The acidity in the citrus
         cures the fish causing it to denature the proteins and become firm and
         opaque while absorbing flavor.</p>
        <p>After the seafood has sort of cooked in a way other ingredients are 
        tossed in such as onions, cilantro, peppers and tomatoes.</p>
        <p>It is such a vibrant dish that is perfect for weekends or parties.
         Truly a recipe seafood lovers will instantly fall in love with,
          especially when you pair it with freshly fried or baked, homemade
           tortilla chips!</p>
        <h3>Using Cooked or Raw Shrimp</h3>
        <p>This version actually cooks the shrimp first in boiling water 
        (to reduce any risk of pathogens and food borne illness, the safest
         option and definitely recommend for pregnant women, children, the elderly 
        and anyone with a compromised immune system). But if you are not worried 
         about it, for the most authentic version you can skip pre-cooking the shrimp 
          and just soak and “cook” in the marinade instead.</p>
          <p><strong>For raw shrimp version:</strong> Soak the raw shrimp in the 1/2 cup lemon juice and
             1/2 cup lime juice for 30 to 60 minutes in the fridge (or until shrimp are opaque),
              then add tomatoes, onions, cilantro, jalapeno, salt and pepper and marinate 30
               minutes longer. Then finish with avocado and cucumber.</p>
        <h3>Ceviche Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shrimp:</strong> I like to use medium shrimp and dice it small so everything is 
                more uniform in size. It is especially best to cut small if serving as a dip.</li>
            <li><strong>Limes:</strong> You need about 3 limes</li>
            <li><strong>Lemons:</strong> you need about 2 lemons</li>
            <li><strong>Roma tomatoes:</strong> any fresh tomatoe will do</li>
            <li><strong>Red onion:</strong> Yellow onions can be a substitue</li>
            <li><strong>Cilantro</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Jalapeno</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Salt and pepper</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Avacado:</strong> not necessary, but it is better with it</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>How to Make Ceviche</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, fill up a medium bowl with ice water,
             set aside.</li>
            <li>Add shrimp to boiling water and let cook just until pink and opaque, about 1 minute.</li>
            <li>Drain shrimp in a colander then transfer to ice water to cool for a few minutes. Drain 
                well then chop shrimp into small pieces (about 1/2-inch).</li>
            <li> In a medium bowl (you can use the same bowl) combine shrimp, lime juice, lemon juice,
                 tomatoes, onion, cilantro, jalapeno pepper and season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            <li>Transfer to refrigerator and let rest 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Toss in cucumber and avocado and serve. It is delicious with tortilla chips or over 
                tostada shells.</li>
