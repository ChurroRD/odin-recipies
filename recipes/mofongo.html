    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Mofongo is a Puerto Rican dish made with crispy green 
        plantains mashed with garlic, olive oil, and pork rinds (or bacon).
         It is very tasty and one of my many guilty pleasures! Mofongo goes
          well with chicken, or you can stuff it with shrimp, pork, or octopus
           salad. Form into large balls and serve as-is, or form into small 
           balls and drop into hot broth or soup.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Canola oil</strong> 3 cups</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic</strong> 3 Cloves</li>
